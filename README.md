# Hospital Surge Planner API

An AI-driven API that generates hospital surge plans using generative models and multi-algorithm forecasting based on environment and disease surveillance data.




## Overview

- Predicting hospital resource surges in response to environmental triggers and disease trends.

- Helps administrators prepare staffing, inventory, and advisories before outbreaks.

- Uses generative AI plus deterministic algorithms, fuses weather, air-quality, and sentinel disease data.


## Key Feature

📊 Multi-factor forecasting: weather, AQI, disease surveillance.

🧠 Generative AI reasoning: creates readable surge plans.

🏥 Actionable outputs: staffing rosters, procurement lists, advisories.

⚙️ RESTful API: easy integration with hospital systems.

⏱️ Configurable horizons: supports custom time windows.
